## Summary
My game is called Life On Wheels, which is a 2D, pixel top-down car racing game. The target audience of this game will be 2D game lover, and racing game lover. In this game, players need choose their own cars and drive them to dodge the obstacles on the road while trying to complete the race in first place. Players need to control their cars by using direction keys. And there will be several unique skills for players to use during the race, such as nitro booster, drifting, shooting, and so on. Players can use their abilities by using Q W E R, shift key, etc. Players need to use everything they got and try to complete the race in first place to beat other players to win awards, they can use these awards to modify their cars, learn new skills, or buy a new car. I decide to make this game support multiplayer play mode because I think due to the COVID-19 pandemic the communication between people is becoming less and less, and people do need another special way to strengthen the connection between each other. I make this game easy to learn and fun to play, so players donâ€™t have to spend a lot of time to learn to play well, but it will not be boring to play. Players will drive their cars and use their skills to race with each other, and they will earn rewards by winning races.
